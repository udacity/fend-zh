I want to give you some practice with [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en)! You'll need to use DevTools to complete this quiz.

Start by taking a look at any page on Udacity (like this one!).

Notice the header bar at the top of the page.

I want you to use DevTools to make [this website](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L3/problem-set/08-udacity-site-header/index.html) look like the Udacity header.
