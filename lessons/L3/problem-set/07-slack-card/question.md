[Slack](http://slack.com/) is a popular chat platform (if you're enrolled in the Front End Nanodegree, then you have access to the FEND Slack team!).

A Slack channel usually shows a list of names and their messages. If you click on someone's name, you'll see a card pop up that looks something like this:

![slack profile card](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L3/problem-set/07-slack-card/card.png)

Cameron's profile card looks great, but [this one](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L3/problem-set/07-slack-card/index.html) does not.

For this quiz, you'll be using Developer Tools to make [this website](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L3/problem-set/07-slack-card/index.html) look more like a Slack profile card.

*Note: the buttons at the bottom of the page have the class* <code>profile-action</code>*.*

You'll need to do [some](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) [research](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) for this quiz. There are at **least two new CSS properties** that you'll need to look up.
